For those new to the phrase,\nyak shaving is a form of procrastination. It's performing an almost meaningless\ntask with the intent to accomplish a larger, more meaningful task.</p>\n<p>This evening, I was working out how I could set up Obsidian to Hugo publishing.\nThis devolved into an over-engineered solution that would require syncing my\nObsidian vault to a server that would host the blog, using an open-source Python\npackage to perform format translations, filter, and push the files into Hugo's,\nthen serve the content. The juice is not worth the squeeze. It's far simpler to\nwrite these files within the Hugo content directory and serve them via GitHub\npages.</p>\n<p>This is already one step removed from the existing deployment flow, wherein I\nwas writing all posts in org-mode with Emacs, then leveraging ox-hugo to perform\nthe translations.</p>\n<p>This is just one recent example; through the years, I've spent too much time\ntrying to be efficiently \"productive,\" when I could just be productive. Most\ntimes I end up being a bit more efficient without being productive. This\nreminds me of a quote I read recently:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The word “productivity” has the same origin as the Latin verb producere, which</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>means “to produce.” Which means that at the end of the day, if you can’t point\nto some kind of output or result you’ve produced, it’s questionable whether\nyou’ve been productive at all. - Tiago Forte (Building A Second Brain)</p>\n<p>This is just one small example. I've spent hours on my Emacs configuration with\nmarginal gains over using something more modern, supported, and widely-used. I\nintend to make a concerted effort at shaving fewer yaks.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"","date":null,"description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/converting-tables/"},"frontmatter":{"title":""}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"23f8efa7-a56b-5226-965d-c714816592dc","previousPostId":"103362e5-f929-50b5-aa36-f75dd9cfb613","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}
